## Running locally

After cloning the repository locally run the following:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then navigate to `localhost:3000`.

## Development
Currently utilises watch mode in webpack and nodemon so any changes you make will automatically be built / updated on both the front and backend! In its current form this does require nodemon to be installed globally.

To get set up in dev mode run the following in one terminal window:
```
npm run hot
```

And in another one simultaneously:
```
npm run dev
```
